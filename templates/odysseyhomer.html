    <h3>The Odyssey, by Homer</h3>
    <p>Adventure. Gods. Goddeses. Mythical monsters. This and more when you journey into the world of ancient Greece as seen through Homer. This book is set a little a after the Trojan War, when all the Greeks start on their way home. The book follows one particular Greek, Odysseus, to see all the challenges and obstacles in his voyage. When Odysseus had embarked on his journey to the Trojan War, he had been warned by an oracle not to go. She said that if he went, he would not return home until after twenty long years. So he tried his best not to go, but alas it was not his fate to have a happy life. As he traveled, he encountered many foes and monsters, the most famous of these being the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, half-woman half-bird creatures, and the two monsters Scylla and Charybdis, the two monsters who guarded the Strait of Messina. Then after all this, he is returned home, only to find that his wife is being pressured to remarry by many young and rude suiters. In a mad rage, Odysseus and his son kill all the suiters, and then the goddess Athena intervenes when the town begins to declare war on him. After this the town of Ithaca reaccepts him as their king, and Odysseus lives with his wife after twenty long years of pain.</p>

    <p>This book by Homer is one of the best in the world. Considered a classic epic, this is one of the most read books for history. This book can help us understand how the Greeks are and what they would be open to believe. In other words this is a great book and should definitely be read by many. <strong>Ten out of ten Homer, ten out of ten</strong></p>
